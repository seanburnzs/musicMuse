# Project Status

## Current Status

The MusicMuse project is a functioning web application that allows users to analyze and explore their music listening history. The core functionality is in place, with several key features implemented.

### Completed Features

#### Core Platform
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, logout functionality
- **Profile System**: User profiles with privacy settings
- **Database Structure**: Schema designed and implemented with relationships between users, tracks, albums, artists
- **Data Import**: Processing of streaming history data from Spotify JSON exports

#### Analytics Features
- **Top Items**: View most played tracks, albums, and artists with filtering options
- **Time-based Filtering**: Filter by predefined time ranges or custom date ranges
- **Natural Language Queries**: "Music Muse" feature allowing conversational data exploration
- **Profile Comparison**: Compare listening stats between two users with visual highlights

#### User Experience
- **Life Events**: Create, edit, and organize life events to track listening habits during significant periods
- **Hall of Fame**: Customizable showcase of favorite tracks, albums, and artists
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

#### Technical Implementation
- **Security Measures**: CSRF protection, password hashing
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous task handling for data processing
- **Caching System**: Redis implementation for improved performance
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes and materialized views for efficient data retrieval
- **API Endpoints**: Support for mobile app integration

### In Progress
- **Data Deduplication**: Identifying and merging duplicate tracks across different sources
- **Profile Photos**: Ensuring upload functionality works correctly
- **Artist/Album/Track Images**: Integration with images for visual display

### Planned Features
These features are outlined in the updates.md file for future implementation:
- **Live Scrobbles**: Real-time tracking of music listening
- **Database Stats Dashboard**: Display of global database statistics
- **Database Optimization**: Addressing duplicates without affecting data counts
- **Mobile App Development**: Native mobile applications
- **Visual Charts**: Listening history progression visualizations
- **Subscription Model**: Implementation of paid tiers
- **Ad Integration**: Monetization strategy
- **Apple Music Compatibility**: Platform expansion beyond current support

## Technical Debt and Issues

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets may result in slower query performance for some analytics features
- Materialized views need regular refreshing to stay current

### Maintenance Needs
- Regular database backups and maintenance procedures should be established
- Monitoring for potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining issues with profile photo uploading
2. Implement database optimization to handle duplicates
3. Develop visualization features for listening history
4. Begin mobile app development
5. Implement subscription model and prepare for monetization

The project has a solid foundation and is ready for user testing while the remaining features are developed.
